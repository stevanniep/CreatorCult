**CreatorCult** is a modern and stylish company profile landing page, designed specifically for content creators who want to turn their brand into wearable and shareable merchandise.

This project was built from scratch without using a CSS framework like Tailwind, relying entirely on pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a seamless, interactive, and animation-rich user experience.
